miriam, you code is good, and its seems that you know the code flow, there is a couple of things that i want you to work on:
- Conventions: you can't use Capital letters in vars name.
- You need more meaningful names, data array its why to general.
- functions needs to be short, 5-7 lines.
- you didn't do the bunos.
- you need to extract the clear form to a function

  other then that - GOOD WORK!
